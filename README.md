# Supervisor(backend)

Backend files repo for the Supervisor app.
SUPERVISOR is an app for keeping track of your employees. You can add, edit and delete them, as well as search them by name or department they work in. In the same time, you can sort them by last name, salary or age. You can keep track of their goals, email them or give them a raise. Last but not least, you get a motivational quote just to keep you going through the day!

## Tech Stack:

- Mongo.DB
- Mongoose
- JavaScript
- Express.JS
- Bcrypt

## Aproach:

Utilized two related models and their controllers with routes for creating, editing and deleting the objects from the database.

## MVP:

- A working full-stack application, built by you, using the MERN stack: Node.js, Mongoose, Express and React. (MVC file structure)
- At least one model with full CRUD.
- A git repo.
- Be deployed online and accessible to the public via Heroku.

# Strech Goals:

- Pull from a 3rd party API
- Have Users who can log in to see the content of the app
- Have routing using react-router-dom
- Have two models that are related
- Graceful error handling for both front-end and server-side errors
- Use a CSS framework like Skeleton or Bootstrap
